Hello all!

Hopefully everyone survived the semester in one piece.

We are going to continue to meet over the summer, but are changing the
meeting day to Wednesdays from 3-5. Our first meeting of the summer
will be this coming Wed, May 22. We will be meeting in our usual
location (Plant Sciences E005). 

Next week we will be moving to Natural Resources 360 (The Treehouse
Conference Room). Fancy!

Hope to see you this Wed.

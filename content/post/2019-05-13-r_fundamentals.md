Hello R-users, 

This week, Matt will talk about how R works at a base level, including
the Read Eval Print Loop, parsing of R code, scoping rules and how R
finds variables and functions, and R's data types.

We will also chat about a plan for the summer. If you've wanted to
participate in R-group this spring but we're able to because of
scheduling now is the time to speak up! We'll decide on summer meeting
days/times that work for most people.

Hope to see you there! Plant Sciences C005 3pm.

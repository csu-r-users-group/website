Hello R-users, 

On Monday, April 29, Scott Haley will walk us through the basics of implementing mixed effects models in R. We'll walk through differences between two packages commonly used for these models: nlme and lme4. Feel free to bring your own data to work with or just follow along with the group. 

Hope to see you there! Plant Sciences C005 3pm.

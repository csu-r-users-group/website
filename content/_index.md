# Welcome to the R Users Group at [Colorado State University](colostate.edu)

We are a community of researchers and scientists at Colorado State
University interested in learning the programming language R.

We host weekly meetings to discuss R. Some weeks we have presentations
on various topics related to R or data science, followed by drop-in
work sessions. Other weeks are open drop-in work sessions, where
anyone is welcome to come with questions, sit and work on a project,
or just hang out.
